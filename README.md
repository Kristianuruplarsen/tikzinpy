# Tikzinpy

This is my (unfinished) attempt at a relatively high level interface to tikz 
in python. There are some examples of what can be made in notebooks/simple_examples.ipynb.
Note the `bshow` function i use to build the figures is hard coded, and might mess up 
your filesystem. Pdf plots are stored in notebooks/test if you just want to see the output.
